Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Gap and, like, woah, what a rollercoaster. Seriously, my brain's still all over the place, y’know? It was one of those movies where you just keep thinking, Wait... WHAT? every ten minutes. 😂 I mean, the plot was doing freakin' backflips the whole way through!

> Like, at first, it was kinda slow, and I was just chilling, almost dozing off, right? But then BAM! Plot twist after plot twist. It's like the writing team was on some kind of matryoshka doll spree, just hiding stories within stories. Mental.

And the soundtrack—don’t even get me started. It was like they raided the best playlists out there. It just fit and got under your skin in the best way possible. You gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie just to listen to that soundtrack on repeat.

Anyway, the characters were either people you love or love to hate. No middle ground. And that’s exhausting, you know what I mean? Emotionally drained but can’t stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 kind of thing. And then there was this one scene, I won't spoil it, but OMG, so gripping. Like the director went, Let's mess with everyone's heads and totally NAILED it.

You ever notice how awkwardly they try to fit product placements into these things? It's like, Oh, let's randomly pan to this perfectly placed soda can. 😂 Makes me chuckle every time.

Oh! Almost forgot, there was this one line that got me good—something like, Even a clock can be wrong… twice a day? No wait, that's not it... whatever, I was tired. But man, what a trip. Next time you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie, prepare yourself with popcorn and a stress ball or something cause holy heck, my dude.

int main() { printf(literally no idea why I wrote this
); return 0; }

Anyway, I'm off to bed after all that. My brain feels like it’s been through the blender. Talk tomorrow? Need your take on it once you've seen it too. Laters! 🤘
